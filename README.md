# DAutoSorter

## It moves stuff around 

This is a utility program that helps the user to sort and manage their downloaded files more easily.

It achieves such purpose by moving all files in the download directory into subdirectories based on their extensions.

For example, all files with .jpg extension will be moved to a subdirectory called jpg. This way, the user can find their downloaded files more easily by looking at the subdirectory names.

It deals with name conflicts by adding the a number to the end of the new filename and incrementing it until the conflict stops, like the windows explorer would do.
